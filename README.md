# Overview

The lab covers the essential elements of network communication, focusing on how data travels across networks, how different protocols operate, and how traffic can be captured, inspected, and analyzed for security or troubleshooting purposes.

# Key topics explored include:

Understanding packets, frames, and encapsulation
Overview of TCP/IP model
Difference between TCP and UDP
Examining IP addressing, subnets, and ports
Basics of protocols like HTTP, DNS, ARP, ICMP, DHCP
Introduction to packet capture using tools such as Wireshark
Recognizing common network traffic patterns
Identifying anomalies or suspicious behavior

# What I Learned

How network packets are structured and how each layer of the TCP/IP model contributes to communication.
How to interpret fields such as Source & Destination IP, MAC addresses, TTL, Sequence/ACK numbers, etc.
How different protocols behave at a network level (e.g., ARP broadcasts, DNS queries, TCP handshake).
How to use packet analysis tools for monitoring or investigating network activity.
The importance of traffic analysis in cybersecurity, monitoring, and troubleshooting.

# Tools Used

Wireshark (or similar packet capture tools)
Built-in system network utilities (ping, traceroute, netstat)
